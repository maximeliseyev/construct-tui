## Overview

Terminal UI client for Konstruct. Rust + Ratatui. Binary `konstruct`. Crate, git repo, and
config directory stay `construct-tui` — that split is deliberate (hygiene 2026-08-22: an
accidental binary rename fought the user-facing name; config was wrongly advertised as
`~/.config/konstruct/`).

This client is behind iOS and is **not** a production-usable messenger. Protocol behaviour
comes from `construct-messenger`, not from this tree or from the April 2026 TUI guide
(`construct-docs/_archive/TUI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`).

Sibling checkouts under `~/Code/`: `construct-core` (path dep), `construct-protos` (prost
source of truth). GitHub org: [konstruct-msg](https://github.com/konstruct-msg).

---

## Build

Toolchain: stable **1.96** (`rust-toolchain.toml`). Core's `rust-version` is 1.96; a 1.92
host failed the first compile after the engine drop with an error that looked like a crate
problem.

```bash
cargo build --release              # binary at target/release/konstruct
cargo run
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt
```

Default features include `post-quantum`. There is **no** `ice` feature. `construct-ice` is
gone; do not add a `[patch]` for it — a gitignored `.cargo/config.toml` pointing at
`../construct-ice` is what made `cargo check --offline` fail on a repo that no longer
exists.

Do not copy `.proto` files into this repo. `build.rs` reads `CONSTRUCT_PROTOS_DIR`, default
`../construct-protos`.

## Architecture invariants

```
screens/  →  app.rs
              ├── orchestrator_task.rs  →  construct-core Orchestrator
              └── grpc/                 →  gRPC-over-H2 (system-root TLS; ams.konstruct.cc)
```

- **This client does not decide what a content type means.** It is the second implementation of
  the protocol, and the first comparison against iOS found the two already diverged: iOS held
  `{12,14,21,23,24,25,26}` as control, `knst::is_silent_type` held `{12,13,14,25,26}`. Both were
  defensible — they answered different questions nobody had written down — and nothing failed,
  because a divergence here is a payload that is a bubble on one client and nothing on the other.
  - Values come from the generated enum: `ContentType::SessionPing as u8`, never `= 25`.
  - What to do with a value is `construct-protos/conformance/knst_content_types.json`, read by
    `knst::tests::content_type_vectors_match_this_table`. `build.rs` exports
    `CONSTRUCT_PROTOS_DIR` so the test can `include_str!` it.
  - **Adding a content type means adding its row there in the same change.** A type this client
    has not learned then reddens that test on the next build.
  - `decisions/wire-format-one-authority.md` before touching `disposition()` or the constants.
- **`construct-engine` does not come back.** Retired from messenger 2026-07-28, dropped from
  this crate 2026-08-22. No `EngineAdapter`, no `UiEvent`/`PlatformAction` façade. See
  `decisions/macos-desktop-strategy.md` — the 2026-06-16 trigger "engine returns if a TUI
  push starts" is retired; the TUI push started and still does not use the engine.
- **Do not depend on `construct-transport`.** That crate is the iOS UniFFI QUIC pipe and
  `QuicClient::connect` wants a **pinned gateway cert** on `quic.konstruct.cc`. The TUI
  talks to `ams.konstruct.cc` over **HTTP/2** with the platform trust store (same as iOS
  TCP). QUIC handshake to `ams.konstruct.cc` times out — Traefik H3 was removed; that
  hostname is Caddy H2. Decision: `decisions/tui-in-tree-grpc.md`.
- **Screens and `app.rs` do not import `h3` / `quinn` / `construct-core` internals.** Crypto
  goes through `orchestrator_task`; network I/O through `grpc/`. `src/grpc/` has no Ratatui
  types and no `App` types — that is the extract boundary.
- **INITIATOR and RESPONDER init paths are distinct** (`init_session` vs
  `init_receiving_session`); tie-break: higher deviceId wins as INITIATOR. Copying the iOS
  "one init path" shortcut produces a permanent AEAD failure against a phone.
- **Session addressing uses `ServerUserId` (36-char UUID), never `CryptoDeviceId` (32-char
  hex).** Mixing the spaces breaks Double Ratchet AD.
- **`messageNumber == 0` is not a handshake.** A sending-chain restart looks the same as
  X3DH. Treating zero as "new session" is how leftovers loop on every reconnect.
- **Device keys are deleted only on gRPC UNAUTHENTICATED (16) / PERMISSION_DENIED (7)** —
  never on a transport error.
- **Advance `since_cursor` only after durable persist.** The server trims to that value.
  Optimistic advance deletes mail. The server also currently rewinds on the initial poll
  (`backend/MESSAGING_INITIAL_POLL_IGNORES_SINCE_CURSOR.md`); reconnect must tolerate
  redelivery.
- **A producer with no consumer is a defect.** If you add a send, a signal, or an action,
  the reader lands in the same change — or the sender is removed. An unconsumed control
  message still costs a ratchet advance (`__session_reset_notify__`, April 2026, four months
  of visible bubbles on multi-device accounts).
- **VEIL is not ICE and is not wired.** `--bridge` / `--headless` / `--config` are clap
  flags, not behaviour. Do not resume obfs4 / `construct-ice`. VEIL is phase D of the TUI
  plan, after 1:1 text works.

---

## Binary data

Same pipeline as iOS. Keys, ciphertexts, and wire payloads are bytes end to end — protobuf
`bytes` or CFE. No base64 in message processing, session management, or storage. Base64 only
at true text-transport boundaries (QR, invite links). Session state that the Orchestrator
asks to persist comes from `export_session_bytes_for`, not JSON.

---

## Code conventions

- TUI screens are Ratatui `Widget` impls in `screens/`. State lives in `App`; screens borrow
  it.
- User-facing copy is plain language ("people / chats / device", never "node / stream /
  replica"). Product name **Konstruct** in Latin. Code identifiers keep domain names.
- Config: `~/.config/construct-tui/` (`session.enc`, `config.json`). Data:
  `~/.local/share/construct-tui/` (`messages.db`, `konstruct.log`). Argon2id is 32 MiB.
- Comment only non-obvious logic. A field left out on purpose at a boundary must say so in
  a comment — an uncommented omission is indistinguishable from a forgotten one.
- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `feat(scope): …`,
  `fix(scope): …`, `refactor(scope): …`, `chore(scope): …`.

## Testing

**The target is not a coverage number.** A test that cannot fail is worse than no test —
it occupies the place where someone would otherwise have looked. Extract the decision
(identity space, handshake-vs-leftover, cursor prefix) and mutate it; do not assert that a
procedure returned. Method: `~/Code/construct-docs/decisions/testing-by-pure-decision.md`.

This crate currently tests storage and safety-number helpers only. Live 1:1 against iOS is
the gate for phase B, not a green `cargo test`.

There is no CI. Do not add a workflow that cannot compile this crate (sibling path deps).
CI was removed 2026-06-19 for that reason.

## Documentation & session notes

Docs live in `~/Code/construct-docs`. **The vault's `AGENTS.md` is authoritative** for
structure and writing rules. If a path is missing, search the domain folder rather than
trusting an old link.

After any session with architectural changes, design decisions, root-cause analysis or
non-obvious choices:

1. Write `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (Context / What Changed / **Why** / Decisions /
   Open Questions) — `## Why` with rejected alternatives is mandatory.
2. If it constrains future work, add or update `decisions/<slug>.md`.
3. Patch the affected spec in its domain folder in the **same** session.
4. Append one line to `~/Code/construct-docs/log.md`.
